A fast-paced 2D side-scrolling shooter where the player constantly ascends while blocking enemy projectiles with a narrow shield. Blocking attacks charges a power meter that unleashes a powerful offensive shot when full, forcing a strategic balance between defense and aggression. The shield only covers a small angle, requiring precise positioning and timing to survive relentless enemy waves. Minimalist art style with abstract shapes and glowing effects keeps the focus on tight gameplay and rhythm. The gameplay loop creates a tense dance of blocking to build power, then attacking to clear the path upward.
You play as a riot guard navigating hostile streets filled with rioters wielding Molotovs, knives, and guns. Using a directional shield, you block incoming attacks and counter with your baton or fists to clear each area. Each level challenges you with increasing enemy variety and environmental hazards, requiring strategic timing and positioning. Your shield has limited durability, encouraging careful defense and aggressive counters. Progress through the cityâ€™s chaos to restore order, with multiple endings shaped by your choices and collateral damage.
