A fast-paced 2D side-scrolling shooter where the player constantly ascends while blocking enemy projectiles with a narrow shield. Blocking attacks charges a power meter that unleashes a powerful offensive shot when full, forcing a strategic balance between defense and aggression. The shield only covers a small angle, requiring precise positioning and timing to survive relentless enemy waves. Minimalist art style with abstract shapes and glowing effects keeps the focus on tight gameplay and rhythm. The gameplay loop creates a tense dance of blocking to build power, then attacking to clear the path upward.
